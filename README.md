# Cobol-Programs

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of COBOL programs that I use to train myself in COBOL programming. The programs are designed to be simple and easy to understand, making them suitable for beginners who want to learn the basics of COBOL like me.

To execute this programs I installed GnuCOBOL on my system. GnuCOBOL is a free and open-source COBOL compiler that allows you to run COBOL programs on various platforms. You can find more information about GnuCOBOL [here](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/).
You can also use other COBOL compilers or IDEs to run these programs, but GnuCOBOL is a good choice for beginners due to its simplicity and ease of use.
You can install GnuCOBOL on your system by following the instructions provided in the official documentation. Once you have GnuCOBOL installed, you can compile and run the COBOL programs in this repository using the command line.
To compile a COBOL program, navigate to the directory where the program is located and run the following command:

```bash
cobc -x path_to_program.cob
```
This will create an executable file with the same name as the program. You can then run the program by executing the following command:

```bash
./executable_program_name
```
